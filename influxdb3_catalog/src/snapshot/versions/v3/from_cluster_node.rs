// This file was not requested, but creating it to show where these From impls would ideally live.
// For the purpose of this task, I will add them directly to cluster_node.rs if this file isn't used.
// Actually, it's better to put them in cluster_node.rs to ensure they are co-located.
// The tool won't let me create this file and then immediately use it in another diff for cluster_node.rs.
// So, I will directly modify cluster_node.rs in the next step.
// This step is effectively a NO-OP for file creation. The logic will go into cluster_node.rs.
// This is a placeholder comment to satisfy the tool's need for a file operation.
// The actual change will be in the next step.
