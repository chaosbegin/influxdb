# only used as a message type generated by tonic-build from a proto definition.
# However, if we define FlightData directly or use its specific Prost types, it might be.
# For now, assume tonic_build handles FlightData generation from the proto.
# If FlightData itself references Arrow types directly in its .proto definition (e.g. ArrowSchema),
# then Arrow dependencies might become necessary here.
# The typical FlightData message in Arrow Flight protos doesn't directly embed Arrow IPC messages
# but rather uses bytes that are then interpreted.
